## Calculating Effective Numbers of Species per Jost ([2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14714.x), [2007](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/06-1736.1))

This package contains a set of simple functions used to calculate species diversity as "Effective Numbers of Species" or "Hill Numbers".
Community abundance matrices can be decomposed into three consitutent pieces -- alpha, beta, and gamma diversity -- as a function of various 
abundance weighting schemes.
